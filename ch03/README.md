# ðŸ“˜ FastAPI â€“ Chapter 3: Project Structure & Vertical Folder Layout

## 1. Overview

In this chapter, we study the **vertical (modular) folder structure** of a FastAPI project. Proper folder structure helps in maintaining large applications, making the code **clean, scalable, and maintainable**.

---

## 2. Types of Folder Structures in FastAPI

### 2.1 Flat Structure

**Example:**

```
project/
â”œâ”€ main.py
â”œâ”€ models.py
â”œâ”€ routes.py
â”œâ”€ schemas.py
â”œâ”€ services.py
â”œâ”€ db.py

```

**Advantages:**
- Simple and easy to start for small projects.
- Minimal files and folders to manage.
- Quick for prototypes or learning purposes.

**Disadvantages:**
- Becomes **hard to maintain** as project grows.
- Difficult to separate responsibilities.
- Can lead to **messy code** with multiple endpoints and models in one file.

### 2.2 Vertical (Modular) Structure

**Example (like your `ch3` folder):**

```

ch3/
â”œâ”€ app/
â”‚ â”œâ”€ db/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ init.py
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€ config.py
â”‚ â”œâ”€ product/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ init.py
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ models.py
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ routes.py
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ schemas.py
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€ services.py
â”‚ â”œâ”€ user/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ init.py
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ models.py
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ routes.py
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ schemas.py
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€ services.py
â”‚ â””â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€ tests/
â”‚ â””â”€ user/
â”‚ â””â”€ init.py
â”œâ”€ venv/
â”œâ”€ README.md
â””â”€ requirements.txt

```


**Advantages:**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each module (product, user, etc.) has its own models, routes, schemas, and services.
- **Scalable:** Easier to add new features without cluttering code.
- **Maintainable:** Easier for multiple developers to work together.
- **Testable:** Each module can be tested independently.

**Disadvantages:**
- Slightly more complex for small projects.
- Requires understanding of Python packages and imports.

## 3. Explanation of Files in Vertical Structure

- **`main.py`** â€“ Entry point of the FastAPI application. Registers routes and starts the app.
- **`models.py`** â€“ Database models for the module.
- **`schemas.py`** â€“ Pydantic models for request/response validation.
- **`routes.py`** â€“ API endpoints for the module.
- **`services.py`** â€“ Business logic and interactions with models.
- **`db/config.py`** â€“ Database connection and configuration.
- **`tests/`** â€“ Test cases for modules.
- **`venv/`** â€“ Virtual environment containing installed packages.

## 4. Auto-Generated Documentation in FastAPI

FastAPI automatically generates **interactive API documentation** using the **OpenAPI standard**. This is very helpful during development and testing.

**Swagger UI:**  
- Access by default at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Provides a **UI to test endpoints**, view request/response schemas, and see parameters.

**ReDoc:**  
- Access by default at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`
- Clean, organized view of API documentation.
- Provides detailed explanations of endpoints and data models.

**Benefits of Auto Docs:**
- No manual documentation required.
- Helps frontend developers and testers understand API structure.
- Speeds up development and debugging.
